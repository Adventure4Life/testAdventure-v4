//--AREA_NAME: A Strange Room

//--AREA_LOOK: You are standing in a cavernous expanse, where the light itself fails to reach either the ceilings or the walls. The light seems to be coming from a unknown source directly above you, placing you directly in the center of a spot of light. You can see a slight grey grid pattern of evenly spaced lines on the floor. They trail off until they disappear into the feathered blackness that surrounds you, giving you a distinct sensation of floating. A feeling of standing on a plane being suspended in black nothingness.

//--AREA_CINAMATIC_START:
You are running.

You slow down and take a deep breath, while wondering how exactly how long you have been jogging. Your breathing easily so conclude it couldn't have been long but you can not shake the feeling that it has actually has been long. A very long time. An age. An endless, timeless age. 

Of nothing.

Coming to a halt you take in your surroundings. The floor stretches away to an unknown distance for it disappears into pitched blackness. There are no features in this space, besides the floor's grid pattern and a Sphere sitting next to a Cube. The blackness is on all sides and above you. There is nothing, not even sound. You find yourself moving again yet you remain in the feathered spotlight, despite a slow but steady gate. You feel no perception of actual movement. This leaves you with a distinct sensation that you are upon a treadmill of some kind. An effect compounded by the oddity of the two objects before you. There they sit, a Silver Sphere and a smaller Red Cube which remain forever a distance ahead of you. Frozen in space just out of reach.

Only now do you realise that the noise is more than a quiet. It is the absence of sound. A sound as black and the void beyond you. A sound that eats all other sound. You can not hear your own breath as it leaves your body or the sound of your feet. Clapping loudly produces nothing but the sensation of force through your arms. Slowly your ear turns inwards to the sounds inside yourself. At first, it was your own heart, then an audible popping noise as your lungs fill with air. Blood rushing through your veins. Bones creaking and cracking. It becomes deafening. Your heart beats faster and louder as panic starts to take hold for you think the noise will enclose you becoming your entire world.

--DIRECTION: south

The transition is instant, there is no perception of movement or discontinuity.

It is like the blankness that surrounds you are walls just out of your arms reach but forever beyond them.
